                    I’ve been there—I know what it’s like to accept pain as the
                    new norm. That’s why, as an MFR therapist, it’s my mission
                    to ease your burden no matter how long you’ve been
                    suffering. Even if you feel hopeless and you’ve heard it all
                    before. Especially if that’s the case for you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By the way, MFR works to release both physical and emotional
                    pain too. That’s because emotions are in the body, not the
                    mind.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you feel like you can’t let go of your past and have
                    trauma holding you back, book an appointment.
