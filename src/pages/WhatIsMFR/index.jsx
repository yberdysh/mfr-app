                  <h3>What is Fascia?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Fascia is the 3D web of connective tissue that surrounds
                    every bone, muscle, and organ in your body. It is both
                    protective and adaptive. It holds your organs in place and
                    responds to any stress that you experience. It tightens as a
                    result of trauma, injury, poor posture, and lack of
                    movement. Often the root cause of chronic pain, fascia also
                    stores tissue memory and emotions from unresolved
                    experiences.
                  </p>
                  <h3>What is MFR?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Myofascial release therapy is a hands-on bodywork that
                    effectively dissolves any blockers or restrictions in your
                    body, both physical and emotional. I as the therapist do
                    this through first assessing your posture and restrictions,
                    and then applying intentional and sustained pressure to
                    release them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    MFR gets your body free and moving again after injury,
                    illness, or poor posture. It helps you break free of trauma
                    and let go of difficult emotions. It gets you unstuck when
                    you’re feeling stuck in life or in your body. The best way
                    to understand it is to experience it for yourself.

                    What if healing is about removing everything that’s holding
                    you back and letting your body do the rest?
